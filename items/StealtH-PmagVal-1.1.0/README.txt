This is a small mod that allows the P-MAGD to work with the AS VAL. For those of you who hate how fast the VAL fires and how small the mags are :)

Changelog:
1.1.0 - Updated the mod to work with R23

Add the StealtH-PmagVal-1.1.0 folder to /server/user/mods

Then

Rechache :)


The server should automatically add the right lines of code to the server.config.


ENJOY
