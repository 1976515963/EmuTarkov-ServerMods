Add the Frumorn-NadeCaseR22 folder in user/mods

Add these lines to your server.config.json in user folder

{
	"name": "NadeCaseR22",
	"author": "Frumorn",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"enabled": true
}

Cannot add proper item names and descriptions as part of the mod without changing locale mods in current version (22.2) but thanks to ragerys for trying to help me get it working
